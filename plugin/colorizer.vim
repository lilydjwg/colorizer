" Usage:
"
" This plugin defines three commands:
"
" 	ColorHighlight	- start/update highlighting
" 	ColorClear      - clear all highlights
" 	ColorToggle     - toggle highlights
"
" By default, <leader>tc is mapped to ColorToggle. If you want to use another
" key map, do like this:
" 	nmap ,tc <Plug>Colorizer
"
" If you want completely not to map it, set the following in your vimrc:
"	let g:colorizer_nomap = 1
"
" To use solid color highlight, set this in your vimrc (later change won't
" probably take effect unless you use ':ColorHighlight!' to force update):
"	let g:colorizer_fgcontrast = -1
" set it to 0 or 1 to use a softened foregroud color.
"
" If you don't want to enable colorizer at startup, set the following:
"	let g:colorizer_startup = 0
"
" You can disable it on long buffers, for example if more than 1000 lines:
"	let g:colorizer_maxlines = 1000
" -1 means unlimited number of lines
"
" There are color strings in the format #RRGGBBAA and #AARRGGBB. The former is
" more common so it's the default. If you want the latter, set the following:
"	let g:colorizer_hex_alpha_first = 1
"
" Note: if you modify a color string in normal mode, if the cursor is still on
" that line, it'll take 'updatetime' seconds to update. You can use
" :ColorHighlight (or your key mapping) again to force update.
"
" Performace Notice: In terminal, it may take several seconds to highlight 240
" different colors. GUI version is much quicker.
